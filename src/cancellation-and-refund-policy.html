        <p>
          At Muscle Madness, we strive to provide the best services to our members. However, we understand that there may be situations where cancellations or refunds are necessary. Please read our policy carefully:
        </p>

        <h2>1. Membership Cancellation</h2>
        <p>
          Members may cancel their membership by providing a written notice to the gym management. Cancellation requests must be submitted at least 15 days before the next billing cycle.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Refund Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
          Refunds are only applicable under the following circumstances:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the gym is unable to provide services due to unforeseen circumstances.</li>
          <li>If a member cancels their membership within the first 7 days of joining.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Non-Refundable Fees</h2>
        <p>
          Registration fees, administrative charges, and any promotional discounts are non-refundable.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Refund Process</h2>
        <p>
          Refunds will be processed within 14 business days after the cancellation request is approved. Refunds will be issued to the original payment method used during registration.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Special Cases</h2>
